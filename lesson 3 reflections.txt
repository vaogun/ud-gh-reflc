When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are collaborating on a project with other you would definitely want to create a remote repository.
Also a remote repository could just be a default so that you always have a back up in the even that
something happens to your computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be in the middle of working on something and if someone else has changed something and git updates automatically this may disturb your work flow.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are used to copy the github project of another person.
clones are used to provide access your project on github and have local access on your machine. 
branches are used for experimental features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote locally stored?

Doing this allows us to compare the code in our local repository to the most up-to-date project code, so the we can resolve any conflicts that we need to.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We could use some other VCS and website. Anything less than this is archaic at this point.

When would you want to make changes in a searate branch rather than directly in the master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are working collaboratively and you want to make changes to master only through using pull request. If you made changes directly to 'master' then changes would not be checked before being committed and changes may take place without collaborators knowing.
