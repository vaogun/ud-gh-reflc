git's merging strategy is basically to merge automatically when it is easy to resolve the merge and to push the developers to do the merge when the slightest bit of uncertainty is encountered. I think that this is a wise decision, because the alternatives are 1: risk merging incorrectly or 2: create some advanced machine learning algorithm that could still merge incorrectly in rare cases. The strategy that has been taken seems the best.
