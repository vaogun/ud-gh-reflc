I think some VCSs allow multiple files in one commit because it makes sense given the medium (i.e. Android development, it would be a nightmare if only one file could be saved in a commit when it could take tens if not hundreds of files just to make an app work). For other mediums (i.e. a coding competition) there is simply no need to save multiple files when all that is necessary can be done in one.
