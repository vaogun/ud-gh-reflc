I am enjoying the class thus far. I have been anxious to dive right back into Android development, but I think doing so with a solid understanding of Version Control, Git, and GitHub will make life mcuh easier! Thanks Carolyn and Sarah!

It was cool using diff to compare files and find the bugs. Simple, but quite effective.
